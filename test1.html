        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
        <p>First impressions are critical. As the initial section of the proposal, the executive summary should do
            two things well: Encapsulate what the rest of the document will expound on and create a compelling
            reason for your potential client to accept your proposal.
            In one to two paragraphs, try to establish your company's credibility, your understanding of the
            client's needs, and how your company can fulfill them. How experienced is your company? Which
            services will best address your client's requirements? What value and concrete benefits can they
            expect if they choose to work with you?</p>

        <h1>The Team     </h1>
        <p>This part is all about establishing credibility. Give a short history of your company or team,
            highlighting experience, client base, or industry knowledge. Then, introduce your leadership team
            or the team members who will be taking on the client's account.
